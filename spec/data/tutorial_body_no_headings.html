<p>In this tutorial I will be remaking Bird's Eye View by Zion I.</p>

<p>First of all, cause it's great.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's chill.</p>

<p>Here's what I did...</p>

<p>I picked a nice kick.</p>

<p>And that snare?  Sounds GREAT.</p>

<p>Then I was like... yeah!</p>
  
<p>Took me a couple minutes, no big deal.</p>
